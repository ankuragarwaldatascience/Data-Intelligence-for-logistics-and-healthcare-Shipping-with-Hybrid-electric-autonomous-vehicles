# Electric Autonomous Vehicles for Logistics and Healthcare
An autonomous car senses its environment and operates without the involvement of a driver. There is no requirement for a human passenger to take control or be present in the vehicle at any time.


There are many applications for autonomous vehicle

Autonomous systems can set high speeds and avoid busy roads using vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The carbon footprint and motoring costs of drivers with driverless vehicles can be reduced by approximately 15% by optimizing driving and convoying.
